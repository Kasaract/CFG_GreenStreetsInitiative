# CFG_GreenStreetsInitiative

Name: The Green Streets Initiative

Nonprofit Type: Environmental and Animals - Sustainability

Project Type: Data Visualization

Website: gogreenstreets.org


## Nonprofit Description

Green Streets' main effort is promoting the use of active and sustainable transportation through monthly Walk/Ride Days which give individuals the opportunity to think about the impact of their daily commute on their health, the environment, and their wallet.


## Project Description from GSI
1) The most interesting project right now is figuring out how to use our data about commutes to and from work to present it on our website in visually interesting ways, through maps and other graphics to share details on how people commute. We would love to create a "Strava" heat map of our commuters color-coded by mode. We have the data to do this but would need more programming skills.  

2) Another related project is determining how those who use fitness trackers can sync their bike trip or walk/run trips with our app directly from Strava (or another fitness tracker, but we can start with Strava)

Deliverable - maps of Green Streets commuters, integration with Strava. 
Desired skills - Github, Django, Python, PSQL, mapping functions

Our goal is giving our community ideas about alternative ways of commuting. Sharing information about how our community commutes and making this geographically specific can inspire others to try another way to get to work (ideally a greener/healthier way to commute).

The volunteer consultant who drafted the initial code (available through Github) is no longer as available to assist with tune ups/modifications. We are looking for help with making some minor changes to our Django app code. In the past we have dealt with lost data and an unresponsive app. These issues were addressed by Red Hat and volunteers.
